In Auditorium from 1pm to 2pm - Dr Arshdeep sing gave a speech on FOOD .He said Food provides nutrients  proteins, carbs, fats, vitamins, and minerals. It gives the energy our body needs to move, think, breathe, and grow. It helps build and repair tissues like muscles, skin, organs. It supports the immune system and overall well-being.Food is not just a necessity; it is also a source of comfort, joy, and culture. Different regions of the world have their own unique cuisines, reflecting their traditions and lifestyles. 
<br>
A balanced diet helps us stay fit, fight diseases, and maintain mental clarity. Food connects people-family meals, celebrations, and festivals often revolve around delicious dishes. With growing awareness, people are now shifting towards organic, plant-based, and sustainable food options. Wasting food is a serious issue when millions still go hungry every day; we must respect and value every meal. Food can also be an expression of loveâ€”homemade meals made by parents or grandparents hold special emotions. Technology is transforming how food is produced, cooked, and consumed, making it more efficient and accessible.<br>
